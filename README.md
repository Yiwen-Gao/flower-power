Flower Power contains the elements of all of your favorite games: Settlers of Catan and Civilization (lowkey-Farmville and Stardew Valley). Join a Faction and compete against other players in gaining control over The Enchanted Lands with your formidable strategic flower planting skills!

## To Play
The game is available for download at [CU Game Dev's Itch site](https://cugamedev.itch.io/flower-power). Feel free to check out our past work as well!

## To Contribute
Anyone is welcome to fork the repo and add to the codebase.
### Getting started:
- Install Unity v2020.1.2f1
- Run the `MenuScene` to launch the game

### A few ideas for further development:
- Add new items like chickens and ducks to the marketplace
- Set up different tile types that affect the plant time and abundance of flowers
- Create a shootout endgame scene
